                Gehan came into handle the online platform in my dept. He came
                in as a specialist in Web designing and was able to take our
                online platform to another level with he's knowledge and
                experience. A hardworker and mostly a team player. What I liked
                about him was that he was always ready to help out he's team
                mates when they needed he's support. Looking forward to see him
                grow in he's career and I'm sure he will be one to look out for
                in the future.

                I met Gehan when he was working as the E-commerce Business
                development executive in our team. He's a very knowledgeable and
                hard-working person. As the digital marketer, we both worked
                together to gain more customers through social media and he is
                also a skilled web designer. A multitasker for sure! Good luck
                in your new path of being the CEO of a startup!
