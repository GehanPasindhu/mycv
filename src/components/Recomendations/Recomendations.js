           Gehan came into handle the online platform in my dept. He came in as a specialist in Web designing and was able to take our online platform to another level with he's knowledge and experience. A hardworker and mostly a team player. What I liked about him was that he was always ready to help out he's team mates when they needed he's support. Looking forward to see him grow in he's career and I'm sure he will be one to look out for in the future.

            I met Gehan when he was working as the E-commerce Business development executive in our team. He's a very knowledgeable and hard-working person. As the digital marketer, we both worked together to gain more customers through social media and he is also a skilled web designer. A multitasker for sure! Good luck in your new path of being the CEO of a startup!
