                  Gehan came into handle the online platform in my dept. He came
                  in as a specialist in Web designing and was able to take our
                  online platform to another level with he's knowledge and
                  experience. A hardworker and mostly a team player. What I
                  liked about him was that he was always ready to help out he's
                  team mates when they needed he's support. Looking forward to
                  see him grow in he's career and I'm sure he will be one to
                  look out for in the future.

                  I met Gehan when he was working as the E-commerce Business
                  development executive in our team. He's a very knowledgeable
                  and hard-working person. As the digital marketer, we both
                  worked together to gain more customers through social media
                  and he is also a skilled web designer. A multitasker for sure!
                  Good luck in your new path of being the CEO of a startup!
